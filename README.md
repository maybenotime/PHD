# PHD
The dataset and code for paper: A New Benchmark and Reverse Validation Method for Passage-level Hallucination Detection (https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06498), which has been accepted by EMNLP2023 findings.

## Motivation for Study Passage-level Hallucination Detection
Previous studies suffer from the following two disadvantages:

### Suffering from noise and counterfactual content
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an effective strategy for mitigating hallucination. However, the retrieved knowledge does not always help and even has a negative impact as the retrieved context can be misleading. In addition, retrieving external knowledge often has complex processes and notable delays. A self-check hallucination detection method can help RAG adaptively call for external resources, enhancing the robustness of RAG.

### Only focusing on sentence-level hallucination detection
LLMs tend to furnish users with comprehensive and informative answers instead of a single sentence. Hence, real-world applications often require passage-level hallucination detection rather than sentence-level detection. In many scenarios, a judgment about the entire passage is enough, which enables a quick decision on whether to activate the retrieval module and generate a new response.

    abstract = "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown their ability to collaborate effectively with humans in real-world scenarios. However, LLMs are apt to generate hallucinations, i.e., makeup incorrect text and unverified information, which can cause significant damage when deployed for mission-critical tasks. In this paper, we propose a self-check approach based on reverse validation to detect factual errors automatically in a zero-resource fashion. To facilitate future studies and assess different methods, we construct a hallucination detection benchmark named PHD, which is generated by ChatGPT and annotated by human annotators. Contrasting previous studies of zero-resource hallucination detection, our method and benchmark concentrate on passage-level detection instead of sentence-level. We empirically evaluate our method and existing zero-resource detection methods on two datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method considerably outperforms the baselines while costing fewer tokens and less time. Furthermore, we manually analyze some hallucination cases that LLM failed to capture, revealing the shared limitation of zero-resource methods.",
